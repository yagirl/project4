<h1>About</h1>
<p>Make Big Brother Blind is founded by Meryll Finister and John Wilson. Inspired by Winston and Julia giving into Big Brother, and ideas from Emanuel Goldstein or “The Brotherhood”. Since Meryll Finister and John Wilson are 
not sure how to be in the brotherhood, they made their own organization and made a few rules to keep this organization alive. Anyone who joins are <i>not</i> allowed to bear children for they are the ones 
who tell the thought police whether or not you have been against Big Brother. Another rule of course is confidentiallity which is why Meryll Finister and John Wislon are not their real names therefore 
keeping their identity secret. It’s goal is to influence enough people to make an attack against this government and save everyone from this brainswashed society. 
Although Julia and Winston could not save themselves, We can and We can try to change the world. The government is wrong and we need to destroy it. The Government will always be wrong unless <b>WE</b> do something about it.</p>
